This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems. The goal is to stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills and build a strong coding habit... one problem at a time.

##  Goal
-  Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day
-  Learn new algorithms and data structures
-  Track progress and stay accountable
